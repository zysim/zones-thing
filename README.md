- Chatroom with one big change
- Automatically detect "posts" and "comments"
  - "posts" are long-form content
  - Comments are shorter things, like sentences, and reasonably a reply to the post
- This is all organized as a one-layer chatroom
- Inspired by how stackoverflow presents comments on posts
- Wordcount separates posts from comments
- This is supposed to inspire blog-sized posts in the guise of a chatroom-like forum
- I'm imagining it having the aesthetic of sticky notes attached to an engraved piece of metal is why
- Markdown user input
  - Image and video handling:
    - Markdown, automatically float right if not on own line
    - If own line, then full-width with 1rem invisible margin
